    Sure, here's a Mad Libs story for "Project Berify":

Once upon a time, there was a(n) 1 company called Berify. They specialized in 2 and were known for their ability to 3 4. One day, the CEO of Berify, 5, called a meeting with all of the 6 in the company. She told them that they needed to increase their revenue by 7 percent by the end of the year. Everyone in the room let out a collective 8! It was a(n) 9 goal, but they were determined to 10 it.



                                        Project number 02 & 03 :- Guess the number(computer & user)

    Sure! Let's play a guessing game. I'll choose a number between 1 and 100, and you can try to guess it. I'll tell you if your guess is too high or too low, and we'll keep playing until you guess the right number.

    Okay, I've picked a number. What's your first guess?

    1.First, you need to choose a range of numbers. For example, between 1 and 100, or between 1 and 1000.
    2.Then, I'll choose a random number within that range.
    3.You can then start guessing what the number is.
    4.I'll tell you if your guess is too high or too low, and you can continue to guess until you correctly guess the number.
